# geolocate interface
Project working with Lavarel 8.18.1, for run the project, do this commands on the folder "/project" with composer and PHP installed :
- composer install
- php artisan migrate --seed
- php artisan serve

I'm not complacent about the update function at the API rest, I think there is better but I didn't succeed to do this otherwise. And, I have chosen Mapbox because it's free, Jquery for to do it faster and use the Laravel's API rest, Bootstrap for some elements on front.
